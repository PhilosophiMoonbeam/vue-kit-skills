# Vue Kit

Use this skill as a task router, not a reading checklist. It is self-contained;
load only the relevant references and the companions needed by the actual change.

Prefer **Bun 1.4.3** for new projects and equivalent package-management workflows:
`bun install` for a manifest, `bun add` for dependencies, `bun run <script>` for
scripts, and `bunx` for package executables. Respect an incumbent project's
explicit package-manager pin and authoritative lockfile; do not migrate managers
or create a second lockfile without a requested migration. Bun is the preferred
manager/launcher, not permission to force Node-based tools onto Bun's runtime.
Follow [setup tooling](references/setup-tooling.md) for lockfile and runtime policy.

## Start with the application

1. Inspect the affected code, package manifest, lockfile, runtime constraints,
   build scripts, TypeScript configuration, and existing tests. Establish installed
   versions, SPA versus SSR/Nuxt, current UI/data/auth libraries, and incumbent
   component, styling, and state conventions before selecting APIs.
2. Choose the host for **new and existing applications**. Use Vue/Vite for a
   standalone SPA; choose Nuxt when framework-managed routing, rendering or server
   endpoints fit the requirements. Preserve an existing host during a narrow fix.
   For **any Nuxt task**, load [Nuxt](references/nuxt.md) first; add
   [Nuxt integrations](references/nuxt-integrations.md) only for the selected
   local library or module. Do not paste SPA bootstrap/router/plugin helpers into Nuxt.
   For a **new application, broad feature, or structural redesign**, use
   [architecture](references/architecture.md) for the ownership decision.
   Otherwise go directly to the relevant task reference.
3. Default new Vue code to Composition API and `<script setup lang="ts">`.
   The documented baseline is [Vue 3.5.44](https://github.com/vuejs/core/releases/tag/v3.5.44)
   with [Vuetify 4.3.0](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/releases/tag/v4.3.0)
   as the pinned authoring baseline and **Vuetify 4.3.x** preferred for a new
   general-purpose UI. These are preferences, not permission to replace an
   incumbent alternative or require Vuetify for headless/3D work.
   Preserve Options API and JSX where the application requires them.
   The example's Router/Pinia/tooling pins are a bounded runnable snapshot, not
   ecosystem-wide version ceilings or instructions to downgrade newer incumbents.
4. Write the smallest complete change. Keep state ownership and lifetime explicit;
   derive state with `computed`, use watchers for effects, and clean up resources.
   Give substantial independent responsibilities useful boundaries, not arbitrary
   file-size splits or a page-sized universal controller. Keep direct contracts
   typed, accessible behavior intact, and server credentials off the client.
5. Select evidence appropriate to the change. Separate proposed checks from checks
   actually run, record failures honestly, and do not claim production, SSR,
   accessibility, or performance support from a successful bundle alone.
6. Keep integrations service-independent. Do not introduce hosted identity,
   provider-key management, commercial cloud SDKs, or account provisioning.
   Application-owned APIs and self-hostable libraries are valid explicit contracts;
   client identity state never substitutes for verified server authorization.

## Route by task

Read the first matching owner. The companion column is conditional, not a request
to load every linked document. Combine owners only when the task crosses domains.

## Resolve API and version uncertainty

- Read installed declarations and the locked package version first. Use the
  corresponding official API docs, tagged source/release notes, and package
  author registry metadata for signatures, peer dependencies, engines, and status.
  Search snippets, old examples, and migration notes are leads, not authority.
- Prefer matching-version evidence over an unversioned “latest” page. If primary
  docs and published types disagree, inspect the installed release and explain
  the conflict. Do not silently mix stable and experimental adapters or majors.
- Vue 3.6 prerelease/Vapor APIs are not Vue 3.5 APIs. Nuxt modules, server routes,
  runtime config, and SSR lifecycle belong to [Nuxt](references/nuxt.md), not a
  standalone Vite bootstrap or manual router installation.
  Select one canonical owner for each resource: Nuxt data or an explicitly chosen
  query integration, not two independent hydration caches for the same result.
- Recommend supported replacement packages and current APIs for active setup.
  Confine obsolete names to explicit migration/historical explanations; do not
  proactively install deprecated packages. An absent npm deprecation notice is
  not proof of current API support, and a repository move is not deprecation.
- Architectural defaults in this skill are recommendations, not upstream
  guarantees. A package's peer range is not observed end-to-end compatibility.

## Runnable resources and honest verification

- [Current bounded audit](assets/current-audit.json): original October 22–23, 2026
  review plus a separately identified source-only workbench extension, observed execution profiles, known failures and bounded GPU receipts.
  Bounded consumers are not clean full-declaration/UI trees: forms, visualization,
  Router's combined plugin/runtime declarations and AI Vue full UI templates
  retain distinct negative scopes. See [evidence boundaries](references/sources.md#current-authoring-and-negative-scopes).
  This is not a publication or fresh remote-install claim, nor a renewal of old runs.

- [Example dependency manifest](assets/example-app/package.json): exact versions
  for the local, in-memory Vue/Vuetify/Pinia/Router workbench. Follow
  [setup tooling](references/setup-tooling.md) for `bun install`,
  `bun run typecheck`, `bun run build`, and `bun run dev`. It has no backend,
  authentication, persistence, or production deployment claim. Its lazy `/graphics`
  page loads GPU packages only after explicit Start: default experimental
  WebGPURenderer or explicit WebGLRenderer compatibility, with real backend/status/errors and a DOM alternative.
  Stop, backend changes, native loss and route exit retire the scene; reentry
  requires Start. Hide/show uses a positive-size draw gate; rotation respects
  reduced motion. No verification-lab runtime or collection is installed.
  For new compatible scenes, WebGPURenderer is the modern standard default posture,
  not a stability or speed guarantee. Its WebGL2 fallback requires the whole
  pipeline on both backends. Use WebGLRenderer explicitly for incompatible GLSL
  ShaderMaterial/onBeforeCompile, legacy EffectComposer or dependencies; it is
  not an interchangeable automatic fallback. Keep the pinned lifecycle limits.
- [Skill validator](scripts/validate.py): Python 3 standard-library structural
  validator. From the skill root, run `python3 scripts/validate.py` or add
  `--json`; an optional positional root selects another installed skill copy.
  It does not execute example tests or builds and cannot establish runtime API
  correctness, accessibility, SSR safety, or source accuracy.
- [Source manifest](assets/source-manifest.json), [source audit](assets/source-audit.json)
  and [coverage routing](assets/coverage-audit.json): retained historical input
  identities and current reference ownership, not semantic or runtime certification.
  Superseded vendor-bound reports remain in repository history, outside this skill.
- [Retained verification](assets/verification.json): stored checks, exact versions,
  limitations and content-addressed packaged files. Stored hashes/commands cannot
  authenticate unavailable original traces or certify changed examples.
- [Fifth-pass audit](assets/fifth-pass-audit.json): native review dispositions,
  corrections and scoped evidence; risk labels are not confirmed defect totals.
- [Support-boundary audit](assets/support-audit.json): registry triage, exact-release
  exclusions, primary sources and executable consumer evidence; not a package allowlist.
- [OpenVue coverage](assets/openvue-coverage.json): all122 pinned official guide
  and component pages, retained native discovery maps, release conflicts and
  explicit final owners/exclusions. Documentation coverage is not runtime coverage.

When verification is authorized, select the repository's own typecheck, tests,
production build, and browser checks that exercise the change. For UI behavior,
cover relevant loading/error/empty/success states, keyboard/focus and responsive
layout; for server code, cover request isolation and hydration. Report the exact
commands and outcomes actually observed. If checks were not run, say so; list
recommended commands separately rather than presenting them as evidence.

Native-device evidence remains separate from autonomous consumer checks. Both
original and corrected focused WebGPU/WebGL submissions are reviewed with limits
in the current audit; the corrected gate and support decision are closed for the
observed recipe configuration, not every manual criterion or device. The selected
successor is the bundled workbench. Its new composition is source-reviewed here,
not claimed to have inherited a native-hardware pass from the recipe reports.
